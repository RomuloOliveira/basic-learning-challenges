My mini-challenge used to learn new languages or/and tools

## APIs and REST stuff

### Challenge

Create an API service to register social media profiles for users, and allow to get last public posts of a registered user. The service must support at least Twitter. Service should be able to return posts for one or more social medias, decided by API user.   

All responses of social media content must be "normalized", i.e., the response entity must have the same fields for any social media support. Additional fields must be properly documented. JSON is preferred.  

### Requirements

- Project documentation
- API documentation
- Unit tests
- Coverage report
- Automatic install/build/run
