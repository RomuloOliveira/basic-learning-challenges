# basic-learning-challenges
My mini-challenges used to learn new languages, frameworks, tools and other stuff.

## APIs and REST stuff

### Challenge

Create an API service to register social media profiles for users, and allow to get last public posts of a registered user. The service must support at least Twitter. Service should be able to return posts for one or more social medias, decided by API user.   

All responses of social media content must be "normalized", i.e., the response entity must have the same fields for any social media support. Additional fields must be properly documented. JSON is preferred.  

### Requirements

- Project documentation
- API documentation
- Unit tests
- Coverage report
- Automatic install/build/run

## Frontend and UI/UX (web)

### Challenge

Create a gallery UI where users can upload images, see a list of uploaded images (paginated), see a list of galleries, etc. The images should have metadata associated, so users can filter and search easily.

### Meta-Challenge

Provide a completely separated backend via REST API, restricting thegallery application to consume and display data only.

### Requirements

- Project documentation
- Automatic install/build/run
